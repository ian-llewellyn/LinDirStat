LinDirStat
==========
Written by Ian Llewellyn

LinDirStat can be used to track down files and directories that are using the
greatest amount of space on your system.

You can load the application from any directory, or pass in a starting directory
as the only argument.

Navigation within the application can be done in a number of ways:
1. by entering the number corresponding to the directory that is to be analysed.
2. by entering an absolute path.
3. by entering a relative path.
4. by using the '..' command to go to the parent directory.
