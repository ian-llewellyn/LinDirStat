LinDirStat
==========
Written by Ian Llewellyn

LinDirStat can be used to track down files and directories that are using the
greatest amount of space on your system.

You can load the application from any directory, or pass in a starting directory
as the only argument.

Navigation within the application is done by entering the number corresponding
to the directory that is to be anylised next. The '..' command navigates to the
parent directory.
